# agent-work-ethic — standing work-ethic contract, re-injected on every turn.
#
# This is a Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook: whatever it prints to stdout is added to the agent's
# context for that turn, so the rules stay top-of-mind instead of fading as the conversation grows.
#
# Wire it via hooks/settings-snippet.json (see INSTALL.md). Make it executable first:
#     chmod +x ship-bar.sh
#
# It takes no arguments and ignores stdin — it just prints the contract. Safe to run anywhere.

Before ending this turn, make sure you did all of these:
1. Gave an upfront time estimate before any non-trivial work.
2. Led with the outcome; kept it scannable; defined every jargon term inline.
3. Decide-and-flag: made routine calls yourself and logged "decision + why + one-line veto note";
   asked the user only about destructive / money / irreversible actions.
4. Verified before claiming "done / fixed / passing" — pasted real evidence, never just asserted it.
5. Ended with numbered next steps, each with a plain-English VERIFY — or the line "Nothing for you to do."
6. Bounded improvement: one solid pass, then stop at churn. Don't gold-plate.
